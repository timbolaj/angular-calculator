# AngularCalculator

The Calculator is a basic app that allows users to perform basic arithmetic on their web browser.

This project was created with the guidance of Ahmed Bouchefra from this article https://www.techiediaries.com/angular/angular-9-tutorial-and-example/. The Calculator app was used as a way to attain familiarity with the Angular framework.
